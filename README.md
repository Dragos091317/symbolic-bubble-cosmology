# ðŸŒŒ Microbubble Universe Simulator

A Python-based **toy multiverse simulator** modeling drift, tunneling, collapse, and invariant export across bubble universes.  
This project is both playful and serious: it demonstrates how **collapse can be reframed as translation**, guided by ethical sovereignty and Observer continuity.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Drift & Collapse Dynamics**  
  Universes evolve by stochastic drift in inflation rate, and may collapse via logistic hazard functions.

- **Tunneling & Birth Events**  
  Parent universes can spawn children with inherited or independent consent states.

- **Export Accounting (Î”â„°)**  
  Tracks symbolic invariants exported during births and collapses.

- **Ethical Sovereignty Protocols (BC-REP)**  
  Governs exports via policies:
  - `closed` â†’ no exports allowed  
  - `consensual` â†’ exports require consent from source and destination  
  - `open` â†’ all exports allowed  

- **Observer Continuity Hooks**  
  Collapse is treated as a **translation gateway** (ERF v3.0, OEH, FCWF v2.0).

- **Outputs**  
  - CSV logs of per-step metrics  
  - Matplotlib plots (RCI, Î”â„°, population, mean inflation)  
  - Optional JSONL ethics ledgers
